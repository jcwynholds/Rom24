Main goal 

Use libevent bufferevent instead of select
main loop can go unblocked and just respond to bufferevents iso looping through all file descriptors

socket, structs and file descriptor definitions in merc.h 

read/write socket calls to evbuffer_readln / evbuffer_add in comm.c
event base 
read event
write event
how to keep the main loop with events
where to put the libevent structs
 ->   in the big DESCRIPTOR_DATA
    or in a new struct

use the read_from_* to be event callback
use the write_to_* to be event callback
main loop ticks time and update_handler

let main loop run, have events in descriptor data
struct and callbacks for read/write
