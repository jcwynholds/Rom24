Main goal 

Use libevent bufferevent instead of select
main loop can go unblocked and just respond to bufferevents iso looping through all file descriptors

socket, structs and file descriptor definitions in merc.h 

read/write socket calls to evbuffer_readln / evbuffer_add in comm.c
bind listen accept in comm.C
main unix loop in comm.c
