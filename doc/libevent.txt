Main goal 

Use libevent bufferevent instead of select
main loop can go unblocked and just respond to bufferevents iso looping through all file descriptors

socket, structs and file descriptor definitions in merc.h 
    each callback passes descriptor_data as arg
    when constructed 
    to the bufferevent 
read_from_descriptor
read_from_buffer
read event 
    copies to d->inbuf

how to keep main loop and event_base_dispatch working
   hand in hand

   move game_loop_unix to event timer 

    in main loop
      daze decrement (based on tick)
      update_handler
      process_output
      sync clock


debugging
bufferevent free crashes

existing player login hangs (does not go into nanny()) 

new player login:
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
get_trust (ch=0x0) at handler.c:707
707	    if ( ch->desc != NULL && ch->desc->original != NULL )
